How to improve this project:

- It would be better if flame was created using atlas or spine, but 10 sprites are wanted as a solution.
- Add a config file from which constants could be derived. That config file would be used to control whole project positions, timings, etc...
- Cover more parts of code with tests.
- More documentation.
- Code refactoring: Reducing the amount of magic numbers, more docs, sticking more to the coding principles of SOLID / KISS / DRY / ETC...
